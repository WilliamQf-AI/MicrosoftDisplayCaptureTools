# Introduction 
This repository contains the source for a generic test framework for validating display adapter devices, such as GPUs and USB-to-HDMI dongles. It contains a plugin model for physical capture devices that can emulate monitors and receive pixel data, metadata, and other channels common to display protocols.

The goal for this project is to provide an industry-wide standard for validating display adapters. The framework is designed to be as generic and extensible as possible, to enable a very wide variety of hardware devices, protocols, and tests to be plugged in.

Specifications for the framework are available on the Microsoft-internal CGA-Internal Git repo [here](https://dev.azure.com/cga-internal/docs/_wiki/wikis/Docs/217/Overview).
